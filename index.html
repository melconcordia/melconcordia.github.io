		<p>I enjoy exploring other cultures through food, travel, and social interaction. Interested in everything outdoors and creative, you might find me at home baking artisan bread or out on a backcountry excursion.</p>
		<p>I graduated in 2010 with a bachelor's degree in Behavioral Neuroscience. After, I went from building affordable houses and cycling across the Southern US one summer to ski instructing in Montana in the winter. I have since turned my attention to startups, hoping to enhance and utilize my skills in design, human behavior, and technology. I am self-taught in Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and happily learning something new every day.</p>
